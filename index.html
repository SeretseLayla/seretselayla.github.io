  					<b>T</b>he language singers use when singing has a huge impact to their listeners which mostly turn out to be the teenagers, this tells us that musicians have to be very careful what they actually install in the confused heads of the teenagers.However you dont have to be rich to be able to get into the music industry but you have to work hard towards your goal.
  				</p>
	  			<p>You can be part of music in a way that you produce it,music doesn't choose  by standards but you need to have PASSION into it,so that you can 		achieve and get in music industry,you don't even have to be rich.All needed is work hard for example of a now famous artist <b>"Kwesta"</b> who 	is now a marrried man.When he was 8years ,his parents divorced.All such he was primarily raised by his mother,we all know that life without a 		father is so misery not to say of being a single parent.
	 				The poor guy couldn't take it anymore so he droped out in high school at the age of sixteen as to help his mother and concetrate on his music career.
